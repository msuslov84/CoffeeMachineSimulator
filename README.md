## CoffeeMachineSimulator
### About:
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we 
should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I've worked on programming a coffee machine 
simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; 
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. We can get three types of coffee: espresso, 
cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
### Description:
This project has allowed me to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, 
class methods and attributes, and I've learned possibilities of enumerations.
